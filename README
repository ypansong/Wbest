WBest
=====
WBest is a wireless bandwidth estimation tool designed for
applications that requires fast convergence time and low
intrusiveness, such as multimedia streaming applications.  WBest
employs packet dispersion techniques to provide capacity and available
bandwidth information for the underlying wireless networks.  WBest
uses a two-step algorithm to determine available bandwidth.  In the
first step, a packet pair technique estimates the effective capacity
of the wireless network.  In the second step, a packet train scheme
ddetermines achievable throughput and infers available bandwidth.  For
more details, please visit http://perform.wpi.edu/tools and refer to
our paper linked on the webpage.

Build WBest
===========
WBest was developed and tested under Linux.  It should be able to build
under most Linux releases.  In Linux system, type "make" in the source
directory to build WBest.


Run WBest
=========

WBest has two executable files: wbest_snd and wbest_rcv.  WBest needs
to be run on two end hosts of the network path, i.e. wbest_snd on the
sender and wbest_rcv on the receiver.  WBest measures the network path
along the direction from the sender to the receiver.  To start a WBest
estimation, one needs to start wbest_rcv on the receiver first and then
start wbest_snd on the sender.

On receiver:

    ./wbest_rcv [-p udp_portnumber]

        -p udp_portnumber       : Option to change the UDP port (default: 1234)


On sender:

    ./wbest_snd [-h hostname] [-p udp_portnumber]
                [-s packet_size_bytes] [-n num_packet_pair]
                [-m train_length]

        -h hostname             : The receiver hostname (default: localhost)
        -p udp_portnumber       : Option to change the UDP port (default: 1234)
        -s packet_size_bytes    : Probing packet size (default: 1460 Bytes)
        -n num_packet_pair      : Number of packet pacirs for capacity
                                  probing (default: 30)
        -m train_length         : Length of packet train
                                  (default: 30 packets)

WBest output
============
WBest reports both the effective capacity and the available bandwidth
on the sender side (wbest_snd). Detailed information of the packet
pairs and packet train are printed on the receiver side (wbest_rcv).
Below is an example of an estimation in an IEEE 802.11g network.

On the Sender:
------------------------------------------------------------
 > ./wbest_snd -h wbest
 hostname: wbest
 Looking up TCP server wbest...
 TCP connected to wbest:9878
 Looking up UDP wbest...
 UDP connected to wbest:1234
 The timer resolution is 1000 usecs.
 The gettimeofday resolution is 0 usecs.
 Ce = 30.185917
 PacketTrain: sending 30 PT with 386.935404 us per packet, at 30.185917 Mbps
 Real sending rate: 30.180879 Mbps, time spend: 11610.000000 us, average packet time 387.000000 us
 Ab = 24.125469
 Total estimation time: 416001 usec.
 WBest sender is now off
------------------------------------------------------------

Effective capacity (Ce) and available bandwidth (Ab) are printed out
during the estimation.  The "timer resolution" is the median delay of
the timer in select function in usecs, which is used to make the
decision of switch the delay timer from select system call to
gettimeofday.  The "gettimeofday resolution" is the median of delay
between two successive gettimeofday calls in usecs, which is used to
end the delayer timer when the delay time is less than the resolution
of gettimeofday.  "Total estimation time" is the time used for the
whole estimation in usec.

On the Receiver:
------------------------------------------------------------
 > ./wbest_rcv
 UDP Server named wbest waiting on port 1234
 TCPServer named wbest listening on port 9878

        packet loss: 0 (0.000000%)
        invalid result: 0 (0.000000%)
        mean At: 25.138786 Mbps
        mean Ab: 24.125470 Mbps
        mean Ab with loss: 24.125470 Mbps

------------------------------------------------------------

Summary of effective capacity (Ce) test prints dispersion time,
dispersion rate and the sending rate at sender of each packet pairs.
The median of Ce is the rate used for the sender to send packet train.
Summary of achievable throughput (At) test prints dispersion
information (after error correction), dispersion rate, and sending
rate of each packet in the train.  The dispersion time and rate may
not always be the samee because the dispersion time is set to the
sending gap if the arriving rate is higher than the sending rate.  This
is used to correct the errors caused by user level time stamps, which
may cause a higher dispersion rate than the capacity.  Please refer to
our paper for detailed information on this error correction.  "mean
At" and "mean Ab" report the achievable throughput and inferred
available bandwidth, respectively.  "mean Ab with loss" reports the
inferred available bandwidth that takes packet loss into
consideration.  The results returned to the sender is "mean Ab with
loss".
